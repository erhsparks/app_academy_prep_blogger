## App Academy Prepwork Week 4

Intro to Rails w Blogger Project

Notes:

- To start up the server from cloud9, use '> bin/rails s -p $PORT -b $IP' (I made this an alias in my .bash_profile called 'c9server') & access at [https://appacademy-prep-erhsparks.c9users.io/][c9address].

- From OS X (and presumably any unix desktop), use '>bin/rails server' & access at [https://localhost:3000/][localhost].

[c9address]: https://appacademy-prep-erhsparks.c9users.io/

[localhost]: https://localhost:3000/
